## Overview

The goal of this lab is to practice using `parsnip` to define and fit models using its standardized interface with a variety of models.

## Instructions

After creating your own GitHub repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L02_fitting_models.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L02.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
